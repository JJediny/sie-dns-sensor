I. Building new sensor packages based on new nmsg releases
----------------------------------------------------------

    Note: This build system requires an appropriate schroot build
    environment, which is outside the scope of this document.

    Assuming new nmsg version "X.Y.Z" and architecture "ARCH". Valid
    values for ARCH are currently "x86" and "ia64".

    1. Switch to master branch.
    
        >>> git checkout master

    2. Add new nmsg release tarball to 'tarballs/' directory.

        >>> git add tarballs/nmsg-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
        >>> git commit -m 'tarballs/nmsg-0.6.17.tar.gz'

    3. Switch to new architecture-specific, version-specific build branch.

        >>> git checkout -b binaries/ARCH/X.Y.Z-R

    4. Perform nmsg and package builds.

        >>> ./scripts/build.sh X.Y.Z R

    5. If successful, commit binaries to the build branch.

        >>> git add binaries/X.Y.Z-R
        >>> git commit -m 'binaries/ARCH/X.Y.Z-R'

    6. Merge the build branch to master.

        >>> git checkout master
        >>> git merge --no-ff binaries/ARCH/X.Y.Z-R
